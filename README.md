pip install numpy matplotlib PyQt5 pyvista trimesh scipy Pillow

its an rcs calculator that creates 2d and work in progress 3d outputs in polar coordinatsystems 
did this cause i am into aerospace engineering


# This code is a complete Radar RCS Simulator with a GUI, 3D visualization, and export functionality.
# It allows users to load 3D models, select materials and radar presets, and simulate
# the Radar Cross Section (RCS) of the model. The results can be visualized in 2D and 3D plots,
# and exported as CSV or heatmap images. The GUI is built using Tkinter, and
# the 3D visualization uses Matplotlib's 3D plotting capabilities.
# The ray tracing is done using the Trimesh library, which provides efficient mesh operations.
# The code includes a material database with various materials and their properties,
# as well as a set of radar presets for common military radars.
# The simulation supports multiple reflections and allows for detailed analysis of the RCS.
# The code is structured to be modular, with separate functions for loading files,
# running simulations, plotting results, and exporting data.
# The GUI is designed to be user-friendly, with clear labels and controls for each parameter.
# The code is well-documented with comments explaining each section and function.
# The simulation uses a combination of spherical coordinates and Cartesian transformations
# to calculate the RCS from different angles and elevations.
# The ray tracing algorithm is optimized for performance, allowing for fast simulations even with complex models.
# The code is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy addition of new materials or radar presets.
# The use of threading ensures that the GUI remains responsive during long simulations.
# The code is compatible with Python 3 and requires the Trimesh, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Tkinter libraries.
# It can be run as a standalone application or integrated into larger systems for radar analysis.
# The simulator can be used for educational purposes, research, or practical applications in radar technology.
# The code is released under the MIT License, allowing for free use and modification.
